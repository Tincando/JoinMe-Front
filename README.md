# Join Me App

Are you tired of going to concerts and events alone? Look no further, my app connects people who want to attend concerts and events but don't have anyone to go with.

## Features

- **Event creation**: Users can create and post events, such as concerts or other gatherings, that other users can join.
- **Event browsing**: Users can browse existing events, filtering them by date, age, type, and city. The app also includes a search feature to help users find events in their area.
- **Age range limits**: Users can set age range limits on events they create, which will be visible to other users when browsing events.
- **Attendee limits**: Users can set limits on the number of attendees for events they create, helping to ensure that the event does not become too crowded.
- **User registration**: Users must register for an account to access the app's features. This helps to ensure that only legitimate users have access to the app.
- **Chat feature**: Users can chat with other event attendees and coordinate before the event.
- **Event join**: Users can join to existing events and see the details of the event like the location, time, and attendees.
- **Event management**: Users can manage their own events

## Getting Started
